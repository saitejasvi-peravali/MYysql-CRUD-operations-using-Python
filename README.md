# MYysql-CRUD-operations-using-Python
The  project  presents about CRUD operations in mysql database using python.

As we know that we can use MySQL to use Structure Query Language to store the data in the form of RDBMS. SQL is the most popular language for adding, accessing, and managing content in a database. It is most noted for its quick processing, proven reliability, ease, and flexibility of use. The application is used for a wide range of purposes, including data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. The most common use for MySQL, however, is for the purpose of a web database. 

MySQL provides a set of some basic but most essential operations that will help you to easily interact with the MySQL database and these operations are known as CRUD operations.
